		<p>In Plate Carr&eacute; mode, click and drag left or right to scroll through the constellations. Right click to zoom into a particular location, in Orthographic mode.</p>
		<p>In Orthographic mode, click and drag in any direction to scroll through the constellations. Note that if you scroll past a pole, left and right controls will be reversed. Right click to zoom back out to Plate Carr&eacute; mode.</p>
		<p>Plate Carr&eacute; projection distorts the poles greatly, so to get a better idea of the polar constellations, zoom in to them.</p>
		<p>Also, you may need to refresh the page a few times if there are visual glitches (missing stars or missing constellations). For some reason, the data doesn't always completely load.</p>
